# skribbl.api
Using a mouse to draw is no easy feat. The results may be fun for your friends to critique, but you know deep down 
that each poorly drawn picture of an apple leaves a scar on your ego. To protect my fragile sense of self worth I've
created some python scripts to copy pictures from your computer onto the canvas.  

## TO-DO

* User friendly configuration of the api (Potential alternatives below)
  * Play audio clips?
  * Display steps before starting configuration 

* Configure drawings to manipulate to the ratio of the canvas 

* Change formatter to continually check for new lines until the maximum value in sobelz is below the threshold

* Allow for shape verticies to be exported and imported from a file instead of calculating them each time

* Make a GUI at some point
